                        Slimes are gelatinous, ball-shaped, adorable alien creatures that live on the far away planet called the Far, Far Range. There are several different species of slimes, each found in certain locations on the Far, Far Range. Though their most common features are the permanent happy expressions they have on their faces when fed and their high pitched voices, each type of slime has a unique trait that is used to identify it.

                    Pink Slimes are the most common slime found on the Far, Far Range. They're cheerful, docile, and the easiest of all slimes to ranch. A pink slime will eat anything you put in front of it.

                    Tabby Slimes, or Tabbies for short, are one of the most common slimes in Slime Rancher. They are easily identified by their resemblance to domesticated cats, as well as their behavior and dietary requirement of Meat.                </p>

                    Puddle slimes are a rare species of slime that live in fresh water pools found on the range. These slimes don't eat fruits, veggies, or meat like most other slimes. Instead, puddle slimes absorb water.

                    Lucky slimes are a strange variant of tabby slimes that seem to have a fascination with shiny objects, particularly newbuck coins. However, coins don't make for a balanced diet and a lucky slime will still greedily devour meat of any kind.                </p>

                    Largo Slimes are a hybrid of two slimes resulting from a slime eating a plort unlike its own. They are twice as big normal slimes and have a combined diet of their two source slimes, making them enticing for ranchers that want to maximize their profits.

                    Gordo Slimes are a rare phenomenon that occurs when multiple slimes of the same type congregate. The result is that the slimes seem to merge together into a much larger slime that is seemingly incapable of movement. A gordo will eat until it bursts.

                    Few ranchers have ever even glimpsed a twinkle slime, with most believing it to be a legend. When they are found, twinkle slimes give away their location with the beautiful songs they sing. On approach they vanish from sight.
